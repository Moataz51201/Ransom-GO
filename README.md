# Ransom-GO
This project demonstrates how ransomware works by encrypting files using AES & RSA encryption and then decrypting them using a private key. The purpose of this project is strictly educational, helping cybersecurity professionals understand encryption techniques, malware behavior, and countermeasures.

## Disclaimer: 
This project is for learning purposes only. Do not use it for illegal activities. The author is not responsible for any misuse.

## Features:
RSA Key Generation: Generates a secure RSA key pair (2048/4096 bits).
AES File Encryption: Encrypts files using AES-256.
RSA Key Encryption: Encrypts the AES key with RSA.
Decryption Mechanism: Unlocks encrypted files using the RSA private key.
Cross-Platform: Works on Linux, Windows, and macOS.
